1. Max Fan Speed for All Fans to lower CPU temperatures.
2. Disable Hyper-Threading
> Enabling Hyper-Threading increases system latency. If you already have enough cores to run your games smoothly, there's no need to enable this. For example, for CPU-intensive triple AAA titles that require more performance it may be wise to enable Hyper-Threading.
3. Disable RGB lighting. You're not going to be looking at your computer, you're most likely going to be paying attention to your game most of the time.

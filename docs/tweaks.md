### There isn't much to do now since the ISO debloated almost everything. We just have to do a little cleanup and a few tweaks.

1. Run my [regedit](registrytweaks.reg) lol
> Check the contents to make sure that it suits your needs. Remove anything you don't want.
3. Update your drivers using [Snappy Driver Installer](https://sdi-tool.org/)
4. Clear your %Temp% files
5. Do a system disk cleanup
6. Disable Background Apps
7. Remove unwanted startup apps to improve boot speed
8. Turn off Pointer Precision (Mouse Acceleration)
> If you do use mouse acceleration still turn this off and use [Raw Accel](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel)
9. 100% Scaling
10. Windows Fix Blurry Apps Off
11. Use the "High Performance" power plan
> You can install a custom power plan or even make your own using [PowerSettingsExplorer](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/windows-power-plan-settings-explorer-utility.416058/).
12. Process Scheduling
> I would have never known about this if it wasn't for [Calypto](https://twitter.com/CaIypto) and his [Latency Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c2-lUJq74wuYK1WrA_bIvgb89dUN0sj8-hO3vqmrau4/edit). I won't explain it because he can do it better.

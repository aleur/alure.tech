### Our goal is to lower the amount of apps being used in the background and there isn't much to do since the ISO took care of most of the bloat.

1. Run my regedit lol
> Download it and check the contents to make sure that it suits your needs. Remove anything you don't want.
3. Update your drivers using [Snappy Driver Installer](https://sdi-tool.org/)
4. Clear your %Temp% files
5. Do a system disk cleanup
6. Disable Background Apps
7. Remove unwanted startup apps to improve boot speed
8. Turn off Pointer Precision (Mouse Acceleration)
> If you do use mouse acceleration still turn this off and use [Raw Accel](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel)
9. 100% Scaling
10. Windows Fix Blurry Apps Off
11. Use the "High Performance" power plan
> You can install a custom power plan or even make your own using [PowerSettingsExplorer](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/windows-power-plan-settings-explorer-utility.416058/).
